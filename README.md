# StudentConnecter
Connect's to Brighton Area Schools' Student Connect.
So, this is an app that will connect to the Assignments section of Student Connect, drawing in all grades from each class. This code will work for other districts as well, but it would require a simple change involving changing the district ID I imagine. I cannot test this feature and therefore did not implement it yet, but if requested I will be able to assist.
