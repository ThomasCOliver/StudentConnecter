# StudentConnecter
Connect's to Brighton Area Schools' Student Connect.
So, this is an app that will connect to the Assignments section of Student Connect, drawing in all grades from each class. This code will work for other districts as well, but it would require a simple change involving changing the district ID I imagine. I cannot test this feature and therefore did not implement it yet, but if requested I will be able to assist.

UPDATE: Currently inoperable from my testing. Seems to be failing when connecting to the website, meaning they must have changed the path to the data. Not currently planning on fixing the issue and may let the project die the death of a thousand cuts - or rather, a slow and pathetic whimper.
